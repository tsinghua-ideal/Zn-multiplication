# FHE Benchmarking Suite - 64-bits multiplication in GZ26 Scheme

This is a submission for the FHE benchmarking suite using the GZ26 scheme descripted in the paper [FHE for SIMD Arithmetic Logic Units with Amortized O(1) Bootstrapping per Ciphertext](https://eprint.iacr.org/2026/233) which is especially suitable for SIMD execution of int64 arithmetic and boolean operations.

The scheme supports *leveled* arithmetic with exact correctness. Given the task is one multiplication of two int64 vectors, this submission instantiates the GZ26 scheme in a *leveled* manner (i.e., not fully), with ring dimension of `2 ** 13` and four 30-bit primes in the moduli chain. Together with two 40-bit auxiliary moduli, the total `log(QP)=201` and this satisfies *128-bit security* as recommended in the [Security Guideline](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/463). The secret key distribution is UNIFORM TERNARY. The only evaluation key is the relinearization key.

In more detail, each ciphertext contains `(2 ** 13)/64 = 128` numbers of 64-bit integer, and the modulus switching after the multiplication consumes 2 primes. We need 2 remaining primes in total to represent the arithmetic overflow in `mathcal{Z}` (See paper), as otherwise the message will be corrupted.

## Installation

We enable OpenMP, NTL, tcmalloc and HEXL in OpenFHE.

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git libntl-dev libgmp-dev cmake autoconf libtool clang libomp5 libomp-dev
```

Using `clang` is recommended but not mandatory.

To run the harness, please make sure `scripts/get_openfhe.sh` is run first.

## Performance

The experiments are conducted in EC2 i7ie.24xl, with 96 vCPU of 5th-gen Intel Xeon (Emerald Rapids). The backend for the code is CPU with AVX512 acceleration using HEXL.

| Instance | Timing (Server Compute) | Bandwidth | Timing (Overall) |
|:--------:|:-----------------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
| Single   |  0.1s    | 3.5M      | 0.5s |
| Small   |  0.12s    | 12.3M      | 0.6s |
| Medium   |  4.8s    | 984M      | 16.3s |
| Medium   |  468s    | 95.8G      | 15.8s |

As the encoding function involves some (naive implementation of) matrix multiplication and fourier transform, more than half of the time is spend on encoding/decoding and (de-)serialization. The *useful* homomorphic computation time is one keyswitch per ciphertext, and it is relatively cheap.

# FHE Benchmarking Suite - 64-bits multiplication

This repository contains the harness for the 64-bits multiplication workload of the FHE benchmarking suite of [HomomorphicEncryption.org](https://www.HomomorphicEncryption.org).
The harness currently supports ‘half’ multiplication with a 64-bits output.
The `main` branch contains a reference implementation of this workload, under the `submission` subdirectory.

Submitters need to clone this repository, replace the content of the `submission` subdirectory by their own implementation.
They also may need to changes or replace the script `scripts/build_task.sh` to account for dependencies and build environment for their submission.

## Execution Modes

The 64-bits workload currently only support local execution mode:

All steps are executed on a single machine:

- Cryptographic context setup
- Key generation
- Input preprocessing and encryption
- Homomorphic multiplication
- Decryption and postprocessing

## Running the 64-bits multiplication workload

#### Dependencies

- Python 3.12+
- The build environment for local execution depends on the Rust toolchain being installed. See <https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/> .

#### Execution

To run the workload, clone and install dependencies:

```console
git clone https://github.com/fhe-benchmarking/Zn-multiplication.git
cd Zn-multiplication

python -m venv virtualenv
source ./virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 harness/run_submission.py -h  # Information about command-line options
```

The harness script `harness/run_submission.py` will attempt to build the submission itself, downloading required Rust crates, if it is not already built. If already built, it will use the same project without re-building it (unless the code has changed). An example run is provided below.

```console
$ python3 harness/run_submission.py -h
usage: run_submission.py [-h] [--num_runs NUM_RUNS] [--seed SEED] [--clrtxt CLRTXT] {0,1,2,3}

Run the 64-bits mul FHE benchmark.

positional arguments:
  {0,1,2,3}            Instance size (0-single/1-small/2-medium/3-large)

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --num_runs NUM_RUNS  Number of times to run steps 4-9 (default: 1)
  --seed SEED          Random seed for dataset generation
  --clrtxt CLRTXT      Specify with 1 if to rerun the cleartext computation
```

The single instance runs the multiplication for a single pair of inputs and verifies the correctness of the result.

```console
$ python3 ./harness/run_submission.py 0 --seed 3 --num_runs 2

Submitters must overwrite the contents of the `scripts` and `submissions`
subdirectories.

## Description of stages

A submitter can edit any of the files in `/submission`.
Moreover, for the particular parameters related to a workload, the submitter can modify the `harness/params.py` files.
If the current description of the files are inaccurate, the stage names in `harness/run_submission.py` can be also
modified.

The order in which they are happening in `run_submission` assumes an initialization step which run only once, and potentially multiple runs for the multiplication.
Each file can take as argument the test case size.

| Stage executables                | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `client_key_generation`          | Generate all key material and cryptographic context.
| `client_preprocess_input`        | (Optional) Any in the clear computations the client wants to apply over the input.
| `client_encode_encrypt_input`    | Plaintext encoding and encryption of the input.
| `server_encrypted_compute`       | The computation the server applies to achieve the workload solution over encrypted data.
| `client_decrypt_decode`          | Decryption and plaintext decoding of the result at the client.
| `client_postprocess`             | Any in the clear computation that the client wants to apply on the decrypted result.

The outer python script measures the runtime of each stage.
The current stage separation structure requires reading and writing to files more times than minimally necessary.
For a more granular runtime measuring, which would account for the extra overhead described above, we encourage
submitters to separate and print in a log the individual times for reads/writes and computations inside each stage.
